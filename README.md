Tower Build
===========
This repository contains my implementation of the Student's Choice project for the App Studio course (minor Programming, University of Amsterdam). The project consists of a game called 'Tower Build' in which the user has to build a tower by adding block on top of each other as straight as possible.

Features
==========
Upon opening the application the user is presented with a base for the tower and a building block that moves horizontally across the screen. Upon tapping the screen, the block will be placed upon the base. The user has to time his/her tap in such a way that the block will fit best. The block is then added to the base and the next block will appear. The parts of the bock that miss the base are removed, making the target smaller and thus harder to hit. The goal for the user is to build the highest tower.

The game has three levels of difficulty: easy, medium and hard. These levels of difficulty differ by the size of the base and the speed with which the block moves across the screen.

User's can also tell their friends about the game by posting their scores to both Twitter and Facebook.

Views
==========
The application consists of a two views. The main view displays the gameplay as well as the score. On top of the screen there are two buttons: menu and pause. This gameplay view is depicted in the wireframes below.

The second view is the menu view. This menu contains 4 options: resume, new game, settings and 'tell your friends'. Resume and new game apply to the game play. Settings let the user chose a different level of difficulty (standard this is set to medium). Tell your friends let's the user share the application on Twitter and Facebook.

Design
==========
The design is desribed in detail in the design document located in the doc/ directory.

Tower Build
===========
In this repository my implementation of the Student's Choice project for the App Studio course (minor Programming, University of Amsterdam) can be found. The project consists of a game in which the user has to build a tower by adding block on top of each other as straight as possible.

Features
==========
Upon opening the application the user is presented with a base for the tower anda building block that will go horizontally across the screen. Upon tapping the screen, the block will be released. The user has to time his/her tap in such a way that the block will fit best on the base. The block is then added to the base and the next block will appear. The parts of the bock that fall next to the base are removed, making the base smaller and thus harder to reach for the user. The goal for the user is to build the highest tower.
Next to a new game and pause button, the application also keeps highscores. Additional features could be for the user to share their scores on social media or to implement achievements or power-ups.

Views
==========
The application consists of a single view. This view displays the gameplay as well as the score and the pause and new game buttons. This is also depicted in the wireframes below.
